MechSys - Open Programming Library for Mechanical Systems

Copyright (C) 2005 Dorival M Pedroso

MechSys is a comprehensive library (through C++ or Python) to the implementation
of software related to Mechanical Systems. It includes a framework for linear
algebra, tensorial calculus, mesh generation, and numerical algorithms.

MechSys also includes the following programs:

	* FEM (Finite Element Method) to the solution of 2D and 3D problems, such as
	  water flow, heat transfer, equilibrium (quasi-static), or
	  hydro-mechanical coupling;

	* MPM (Material Point Method) to the solution of dynamic and equilibrium
	  problems.

MechSys/FEM and MechSys/MPM programs run inside a very friendly graphical
interface (GUI) based on Blender (www.blender.org), where CAD, mesh generation,
simulations, and visualisation co-exist.
